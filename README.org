* Todo App

This app is meant as a small hello world for those who want to use
ReactReason with nix, and maybe direnv

** Usage

If you use direnv, just =direnv allow= and do

#+begin_src sh
  npm install
#+end_src

Then

#+begin_src sh
  npm run watch
#+end_src

In one screen and in another screen do

#+begin_src sh
  npm run serve
#+end_src

If you don't use direnv, first do

#+begin_src sh
  nix develop
#+end_src

If you don't use nix, you need to setup nodejs, npm, and opam. I don't
know how to setup those manually, so good luck with that (You can open
a PR to this documentation if you know how to setup everything
manually).
